# SpeakEval 
SpeakEval is an AI-powered prototype built to make examinations accessible, secure, and inclusive.
Our platform empowers millions of disabled students — who currently rely on scribes or assistants — to take exams independently using just their voice.
* Spoken answers are converted into text and evaluated by AI against faculty-provided criteria.
* Real-time face tracking, eye gaze detection, and speech monitoring ensure attentiveness and integrity.

**Features**  

* Face Detection – Detects if a person is present in front of the camera.  
* Multiple Face Detection – Flags if more than one person is in the frame.  
* Eye Gaze Tracking – Checks if the user is looking away from the screen.  
* Speech Monitoring – Ensures the user speaks only when recording is enabled.  
* Evaluation Mode – Captures and analyzes responses for further assessment.  

**Tech Stack - Python** 

* Flask → Lightweight backend framework (API handling, server-side logic)
* OpenCV → For face detection, monitoring attention & eye movement
* SpeechRecognition → To convert speech to text
* PyAudio → To capture microphone input in real-time
